# opttransport
Optimal transport between a density and a sum of Dirac masses.

This code implements the algorithm presented in the article *"A multiscale approach to optimal transport"*, CGF 30**(5)**, 2011, pp 1583--1592.

**This implementation is obsolete, and one should use the more robust and more efficient [MongeAmpere](https://github.com/mrgt/MongeAmpere) solver, which comes with a Python wrapper [PyMongeAmpere](https://github.com/mrgt/MongeAmpere).**
